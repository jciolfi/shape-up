## Proposal

### Target Users
Adults with limited fitness experience looking to stay active with friends.

### What problem/task(s)/need does the application help the users address?
The app tries to motivate users to work out, even if they havenâ€™t felt up to it previously. It allows
users to track their workout program and progress in a fun and engaging way, with support from
friends.

#### What three current apps on the Play Store (or other app stores, such as iTunes) would be your closest competitors?
* Apple Fitness
* Beginners Gym Workout
* 7 Minute Workout


### What about your app design will keep people engaged using it for a long time, even once the novelty wears off?
The users are encouraged to continue to use the app due to the social aspect as well as the gamification of workouts. Users can make new friends who mutually encourage each other to
continue to stay fit. The potential real world benefits, such as users achieving health goals, could also be another factor in keeping users engaged for a long time
